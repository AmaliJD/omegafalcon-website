I challenged myself to make OmegaFalcon more expressive. In his typical rigid cube shape, I find OmegaFalcon pretty difficult to pose. Here, I contorted his body and "legs" so it actually looks like he's taking a stance. I drew eyebrows for more facial expression, a mouth to complete the more human appearance, and hands to really give proper form to his stance. Now he looks like he has a full body!

For the mouth, I didn't want something that would significantly change how the face looked. Something like the iconic Geometry Dash icon's rectangular mouth would have done that, and would make him look like a completely different character. I drew this style of mouth to make it look like his mouth was closed shut and he's streatching it back open, creating these thin strips where the skin tears. I really like how this makes it look kind of like a furnace cover, with a fire raging within his body.
